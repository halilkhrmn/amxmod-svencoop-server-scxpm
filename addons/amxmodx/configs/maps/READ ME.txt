Server manager:

PLEASE use the .ini in this folder to disable xp mod,xp mod will break the atmosphere of the map and is really dont needed because no enemies in the map

The plugin will be disabled in this map and will run again when the map changes.

SO PLEASE use this,you won't  die for disabled xp mod on this map

if you are running scxpm with other name like scxpm_v18.amxx just rename the line

scxpm.amxx disabled
to
scxpm_v18.amxx disabled

Thanks.

Streamfox & Maiten
